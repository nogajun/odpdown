## An alternative way to mark 2nd Level Headers

> **strong** emphasis, or even ***double-emphasis*** in
> your text. But wait, there's more!
>
> In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order
> function is a function that does at least one of the
> following:
>
> - takes one or more functions as an input
> - outputs a function
